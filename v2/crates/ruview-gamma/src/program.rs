//! Neuromodulation programs (ADR-250 extension: adaptive sensory

//!
//! The platform thesis: RuView turns the body into the feedback signal,
//! RuVector turns repeated sessions into a personal response map, the device is
//! the actuator, and RuFlo makes the loop governed and auditable. The *real*
//! product is a personal neural-rhythm optimization platform — and each use
//! case is a [`NeuroProgram`] bundling its own safety envelope, starting prior,
//! objective weighting, physiological-state gating, evidence level, and the
//! single claim it is allowed to make.
//!
//! **Claim discipline is structural:** a program's [`NeuroProgram::claim`] is
//! always an *optimization / monitoring* statement, never a disease-treatment
//! claim. The disease context lives only in [`EvidenceLevel`], and a claim is
//! only releasable once the program clears its acceptance gate
//! (`crate::acceptance`).
